Student Study Habits and Exam Performance Dataset
Collection Method:
I designed a simple survey questionnaire and collected data from 50 students at my university. Each student was asked about their age, gender, daily study hours, internet usage hours, class attendance, and exam results. Based on the exam results, students were also categorized as pass or fail.

Description of Features & Labels
Features (X):
This dataset includes several features that describe students’ study habits and behavior. The features are age, gender, study hours per day, internet usage hours, and attendance percentage. These features provide information about how students manage their time and how regularly they attend classes.
Label (y):
The label of the dataset is Pass_Fail, which is derived from the exam result. It indicates whether a student passed or failed the exam.
This dataset is treated as a classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their study habits and attendance.

Dataset Structure
The dataset contains 51 rows and 7 columns. Each row represents one student, and each column represents a specific feature related to the student’s study habits or exam performance.


Quality Issues

The dataset contains several data quality issues that are commonly found in real-world data. Some rows have missing values, especially in the Study_Hours and Internet_Hours columns, because not all students provided complete information.

There are also categorical values such as gender and pass/fail, which need to be converted into numerical form before using the data in a machine learning model. In addition, there may be minor inconsistencies in how data is entered, such as differences in letter case.

Another issue is class imbalance, where the number of students who passed the exam is higher than those who failed. This can affect classification results if not handled properly.


Use Case

This dataset can be used in a machine learning classification project. The main goal is to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on their study habits, internet usage, and class attendance.

It can also be used for a regression task by predicting the exam result score instead of pass or fail. In addition, the dataset can be applied to clustering, where students can be grouped based on similar study behaviors, such as high study hours with low internet usage or low attendance with poor performance.
